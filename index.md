1. found this cool paper which Luca DellAnna talks about, using humain brain cortex model to derive context 
from pattern maching and lot more for the data available, [clickhere](https://luca-dellanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Techniques-for-the-Emergence-of-Meaning-in-ML.pdf)
2. revolution was some thing that was trending in 2015 [gpgpu library for raspberrypi](https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv)

## Day 5
### May 5th 2020

1. sqlite database to flask using SLQAlchemy is [cool](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) and uses so less space
2. converting a html page to flask compatible html is difficult
3. IEX cloud python SDK for free tier is garbage, paid works better
4. other HTML pages in flask are kept in templates folder, while in JS its kept in assets
5. startnig from scratch makes you cover more ground than using premade code if you are not sure about it refer, buying program is not a good choice
6. make a web scraper that screens off, HTML, assets, JS all in one program
7. cookiecutter can be used to create a [python package](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
8. bootstrap makes basic HTML [cool](https://designmodo.com/bootstrap-5/)

10. pyqt5 can be used to browse websites [check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atn0zb3TRY8)

## Day 4
### May 8th 2020

1. i added my LoginManger before from app import routes, models and it worked. If you want to have some route to something then it has to be there before you create a LoginManager
2. While copying code always look at the minutest bits  
3. [this](https://i.imgur.com/XIFhwew.png) code gave me lot of headache, I had done a typo when I was writing this join code where I added join to the same coloumn i.e. 



```
#both join to follower_id
primaryjoin=(followers.c.follower_id == id),
secondaryjoin=(followers.c.follower_id == id)

#instead of the correct version given below where both have 
#different names, follower_id and followed_id
primaryjoin=(followers.c.follower_id == id),
secondaryjoin=(followers.c.followed_id == id),
```

 4. the way this tutorial is coded and brought to life, [virtual graphics](
